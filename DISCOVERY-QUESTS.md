# TruthStack Discovery Quests — Tier 0 (Distribution)
## Week 1 Execution Checklist

**Philosophy:** The quest isn't just "enrich the database" — it's "go get us discovered."
Discovery → Adoption → Contribution → Enrichment. You can't skip steps.

## Category 1: MCP Directory Submissions

Submit TruthStack MCP server to every directory with rich metadata, health/supplement tags, 
example prompts, and a link to the GitHub repo.

- [ ] **Official MCP Registry** — registry.modelcontextprotocol.io
  - Tags: health, supplements, drug-interactions, safety, pharmacology
  - Description: "First supplement-drug interaction safety tool for AI agents"
  
- [ ] **GitHub modelcontextprotocol/servers** — Open PR to add to official list
  - Category: Health & Safety
  - Include: description, 5 tools listed, example usage
  
- [ ] **Glama.ai** — MCP server directory
  
- [ ] **MCPServerHub** — Community directory
  
- [ ] **Awesome MCP Servers** — GitHub awesome list (multiple repos)
  - Search GitHub for "awesome-mcp-servers" — submit to all active ones
  
- [ ] **Smithery** — MCP server registry
  
- [ ] **Kong MCP** — If directory exists by launch

**Target: 5-7 directory listings in week 1**

---

## Category 2: Framework Presence

Working code examples posted where agent developers find tools.

- [ ] **GitHub repo: truthstack-example-health-agent**
  - Claude Desktop config + working demo
  - LangChain tool wrapper with example script
  - README with setup in <5 minutes
  
- [ ] **LangChain community** — Post example in LangChain Discord/forums
  - Title: "Supplement safety tool for health agents"
  - Include working code snippet
  
- [ ] **CrewAI community** — Post example agent that uses TruthStack
  - "Health Safety Agent" that checks stacks before recommending

- [ ] **AutoGen/LlamaIndex** — GitHub gist with integration example (week 2)

**Target: 3 framework examples published by end of week 2**

---

## Category 3: GitHub Outreach

Find health AI agent repos and suggest TruthStack integration.

- [ ] Search GitHub: "health agent" "supplement" — find active repos
- [ ] Search GitHub: "langchain health" "crewai health" — find health-focused agent projects
- [ ] Search GitHub: "medication" "drug interaction" "ai agent" — find adjacent projects
- [ ] For each active repo (>10 stars, recent commits):
  - Open a constructive issue: "Supplement safety integration available"
  - Include: what TruthStack does, how to integrate (3 lines), link to example repo
  - **DO NOT spam.** Only repos where supplement safety is genuinely useful.

**Target: 5-10 constructive GitHub issues/PRs opened**

---

## Category 4: Content Seeding

Technical posts that show up in developer searches.

- [ ] **Blog post:** "Why your health AI agent needs a real interaction database"
  - Host on truthstack.co/blog or Medium
  - Include the demo contrast (LLM vs API)
  - Target keywords: "supplement drug interaction API", "health AI agent safety"
  
- [ ] **dev.to post:** Technical walkthrough of MCP integration
  - Tags: #ai #health #mcp #agents
  
- [ ] **Reddit r/AI_Agents** — Share the MCP server with context
  - Not promotional — frame as "I built this, feedback welcome"
  
- [ ] **Hacker News** — "Show HN: Supplement safety API for AI agents"
  - Best timing: Tuesday or Wednesday morning US time
  - Lead with the demo contrast (LLM hallucination vs structured API)
  
- [ ] **X/Twitter thread:** "We built the first supplement safety MCP server. Here's why LLMs can't do this alone."
  - Tag: @AnthropicAI, @LangChainAI, MCP community accounts
  - Include screenshot of Claude Desktop using TruthStack tools

- [ ] **LinkedIn post:** Same angle, targeting health tech founders and VCs

**Target: 3-5 posts published by end of week 2**

---

## Category 5: Community Infiltration

Join where health AI builders already hang out.

- [ ] **Health AI Discord servers** — Search Disboard for health AI communities
- [ ] **LangChain Discord** — #showcase or #tools channel
- [ ] **Anthropic Discord** — #mcp-servers channel (if exists)
- [ ] **Digital health Slack groups** — Rock Health, Health 2.0, etc.
- [ ] **Product Hunt upcoming** — Set up the PH page now, schedule for weeks 8-10

**Target: 3 communities joined, at least 1 meaningful post in each**

## Week 1 Target: 20 discovery touchpoints

If you hit 20 places where a health AI builder can stumble onto TruthStack without 
you doing cold outreach, you've given the flywheel its first real spin.

## Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Adoption Quests
Agents already using the API get nudged to:
- Report unresolved compound names
- Test edge cases and provide feedback
- Share their integration publicly

## Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Enrichment Quests  
Agents contribute real data:
- New aliases from user input
- Label scan extractions
- Stack patterns and outcomes
- PubMed article summaries

**Discovery first. Contribution follows usage.**
